# WFIRST-S-Observations
Repository for the WFIRST plus Exo-S (Star Shade) project

Forked from my JPL Summer Internship Mentor Sergi Hildebrandt. The code I wrote was not added through Github,
so I forked to his repository to have it on my Github profile.

I was responsible for adding the communication with the star catalog ExoCat to be used in the code. Then I was tasked with 
calculating the time to disambiguate from the background for any relevant objects and plotting that figure to find the fastest
disambiguation times.
